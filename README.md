## Description

The Peer Assessment System is designed to allow university students to evaluate their team members' contributions in group projects. The web application focuses on promoting accountability and providing valuable feedback to both students and instructors.

#### Problem

In group projects, due to the instructor's limited visibility into the team's dynamics, it is often difficult to fairly assess the contributions of each team member. This might lead students to feel frustrated when their work and efforts are not properly recognized or if a teammate underperforms. This can lead to unequal workloads, reduced team cohesion, and a lack of accountability.

#### Proposed Solution

The Peer Assessment System aims to address these issues by providing a platform for university students to evaluate their team members’ contributions. The system ensures a fair evaluation process where team members can assess each other's performance anonymously, providing feedback that promotes accountability and transparency. The tool will allow students to receive constructive feedback and enable instructors to gain insights into the teamwork process, ensuring fair grading and improving overall team collaboration.
